<h1 align="center">Student Peer Review App</h3>

  <p align="center">
     This Peer Review App was my senior project at UTD. It was designed to assist with student collaboration and improve teamwork assessment. 
     This application allows students to submit peer reviews for both themselves and their teammates and generates performance reports with their average ratings.

<!-- DEMO -->
## Demo

If the review period is active, the student signs in and is presented with a set of instructions, a table with drop-down boxes, and a text box.
- Each dropdown contains a value from 0-5 on which they can rate their teammates on 5 criteria.  
- The textbox is a comment section, the student may leave a private comment about their teammate which the professor can read over.

Additionally, when the review period is active the student will not be able to access the Performance Report page.

<br></br>
If the review period has ended, when the student signs in, they will now be able to access the data on the Performance Report page. 
Here the student is given: 
- The calculated average of their scores on each of the 5 criteria
- The individual scores given by each of their teammates.

 Additionally, they will no longer be able to submit a peer review.
